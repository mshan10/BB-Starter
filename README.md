# Foobar

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Setup
#### Terminal 
###### Windows Users
Windows uses a DOS based terminal with the command prompt in contrast to a UNIX based system present in Mac Linux devices. UNIX is a much more standard and intuitive command line interface to use so we will need to download a UNIX based command line. Some options are [Ubuntu] which is installed on Windows Subsystem for Linux or [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

###### Mac Users
Use default terminal which is Unix based
